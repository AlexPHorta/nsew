NSEW Virtual Keyboard
=====================

![NSEW Virtual Keyboard](images/logo.png)

**NSEW** is a virtual keyboard designed for text insertion with the directional keys of a remote controller (_up_, _right_, _down_, _left_ and _enter_) or a numpad. The normal keyboard layout (a retangular box) is clumsy when used with this kind of device or in these specific conditions.

**NSEW** solves this situation minimizing the number of strokes needed to select a specific character, in accordance with the common letter frequency of the selected language (English is the default).

The user presses the directional keys until the desired character is under the cursor, then presses ENTER (or 5, in this demonstration). The chosen character is inserted in the field area and the cursor gets back to the central position (the _Mode_ key).

<!-- ## Getting Started

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

<!-- ## Running the tests

## Deployment

NSEW is very simple to use. Simply add the *NSEW_container* ID to an empty *div*, and a *NSEW_input* class to an *input* element.

## Built With
